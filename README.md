# Stability Rate Analysis of Dynamic System Models Tumor Therapy

 This study aims to form a mathematical model in the form of a first order differential equation system about tumor therapy using a virus and explain the behavior of a differential equation solution from a tumor therapy model with a virus. The results of this study are the models obtained from several assumptions used derived from competition between viruses and tumor cells.
